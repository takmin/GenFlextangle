You need OpenCV library to build this program (3.4 or later).
I prepared windows10 execution "GenFlextangle.exe" in "GenFlextangle_win_binary.zip", so you can use this program without compile. You need visual studio v15 redistribution package.

How to use:
1. Enter an image file path, then the image is displayed
   in new window.
2. Surround image area by a hexagon.  Drag center of
   hexagon to move, and drag corner to rescale and rotate.
3. Press enter or space key to select a next image.
   Or press ESC or 'q' key to quit program.
4. Repeat for 4 images.
5. Enter image file name path to save.

Future Work:
I want to transfer this program to javascript with OpenCV.js.
If someone want to do it instead, it's very welcome.
